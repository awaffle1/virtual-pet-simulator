# Virtual Pet Simulator

Welcome to virtual pet simulator! Hopefully I can come up with an actual title soon, but for now you're stuck with that.

There is no saving mechanic yet and the only thing you can do is walk your pet which exists now. Trust me, all of the core stuff will be added soon, all you have to do is wait...

Or you can help. Open a pull request, and you can drop your name in contributors.txt as well!

## Installation Instructions

### Linux

Download the binary from the Releases tab and run it in your terminal.

### Windows

You'll have to download the code and self-compile. I use GCC so you're really on your own if you use Windows when it comes to compilers. I'm pretty sure the code is C++11 compliant so you shouldn't have to worry. Compiling should only take a second.

### Mac

The binary might work on Mac although don't take my word for it. If it doesn't work, use the same method as Windows and self-compile.

# Virtual Pet Simulator

Welcome to virtual pet simulator! Hopefully I can come up with an actual title soon, but for now you're stuck with that.

New saving mechanic added. There's only one save file available, but you can always back up your save files and make multiple saves manually. I plan to add a way you can have multiple save files in a future update. All you have to do is wait...

Or you can help. Open a pull request, and you can drop your name in contributors.txt as well!

## Installation Instructions

### Linux

Download the binary from the Releases tab and run it in your terminal.

### Windows

You'll have to download the code and self-compile. I use GCC so you're really on your own if you use Windows when it comes to compilers (gcc might work on windows). I'm pretty sure the code is C++11 compliant so you shouldn't have to worry. Compiling should only take a second.

### Mac

The binary might work on Mac although don't take my word for it. If it doesn't work, use the same method as Windows and self-compile.
